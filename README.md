Python script to create a bullet journal in an plain textfile with Markdown formatting

This project is not about software in the first place. It is about the idea of using the concept of a [bulletjournal](http://bulletjournal.com/) in a plain textfile. The second idea is to use [markdown-formatting](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Thus, the bulletjournal-file could be used with a markdown-editor or copied into a CMS like [yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow). In addition to templates, there is a [python script](#python-script-bjmdpy) to create templates on your own.

## Python Script bjmd.py

Use the [script](scripts) in a terminal like this:

> $> python bjmd.py > mybulletjournal.txt

* Use this script to create a bullet journal textfile for a whole year.
* The Language of textfile follows the **locale** of your OS.
* See [standard-output.md](https://github.com/fulgor/bulletjournal.md/blob/master/scripts/standard-output.md) of bjmd.py when options are unaltered on a system with locale EN.
* Settings (that you may change in the script, of course):
  * prefix = 4 blanks before day in shortlist
  * suffix = 2 blanks after weekday list
  * this year or specified year
  * include keys and their meaning on top 
  * include calendarmatrix (off, needs manual correction)
  * reversemonth = list order is December to January
  * reverseday = list order is last day of week to first day of week
  * set first day of week (MONDAY)

## FAQ

* **Why is the default list order descending?** It's because Soren Kierkegaard said, that life must be lived forwards, but can only be understood backwards. Moreover, in a textfile it seems easier to work upwards. But you may change the script easily.
* **What are the advantages of bulletjournaling in a textfile?** You may: search the full text, copy and paste, replace, delete. Moreover, you don't have to estimate how many pages you need to spare for a project or list.
* **What are the limitations of bulletjournaling in a textfile?** Obviously, you need a laptop or smartphone. Then, in a file there are no pagenumbers for an index. And there is no color-coding.
